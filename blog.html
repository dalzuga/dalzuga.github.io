            <p class="blog-post-meta">May 9, 2016 by <a href="#">Daniel</a></p>
            <p>If I could go back in the past 10 years and send myself a message on how to start my career in programming, this is it.</p>
            <p>Today, I am 25 years old. I’ve always loved computers (Yes, you). But the barrier-to-entry to start a carrier has always seemed (will always seem,) an oversupply of information and lack of direction. If you’re lucky and work smart, you can make it to a top <a href="http://holbertonschool.com">software development program</a>; but if you don’t (and the simple math is that not everyone can get in), here are messages that will help you the most in overcoming this barrier:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Low-level programming exercises are your bread and butter.</li>
              <li>Soft-skills are your greatest learning tool, provided you practice every day doing your low-level programming exercises</li>
              <li>Use your own customizable IDE</li>
              <li>Take your time; but the longer you take, the more hours you need to dedicate to programming</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Expand.</p>

            <p>If you understand low-level programming, you are 25% done. One big fat (with lots of exercises) C programming book is enough. In fact, since you are 15 years old, I know for sure that you already have that book; but since that book is hard to find online and you may have left it at your mother’s house, here is another book that you can read because your English at this time is good enough: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1462310358&sr=8-2&keywords=programming+in+c"></a>The C Programming Language 2nd Edition ISBN-13: 978–0131103627. Don’t worry, it was released in 1988 (I wouldn’t link you to a book from the future… duh). Make sure you do the exercises.</p>

            <p>My next piece of professional advice: soft skills are just as important as low-level programming, if not more; the fastest way to learn is to learn from other people. At the time you receive this message, Twitter will only be 2 weeks old (I checked). Tweeting every day is the best way to start working on your soft-skills and your personal brand. As to the next best thing to practice your soft skills, dedicate your time to polish your front-end as well. Learning HTML and CSS will allow you to make your own website, which you can customize to your liking.</p>

            <p>Which brings me to your Integrated Development Environment (or “IDE” for short.) The best way for you to program is to use the Emacs text editor. If you were in the future with me, you’d know that <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/index.html">GNU has released a new Emacs website with cool videos</a> explaining its features.  But since you don’t have access to it, you can use the hotkey combination Control-h + ‘t’ from an emacs window to bring up the tutorial. The learning curve of Emacs is much easier than the Vim text editor, which I don’t yet use. And the best way for you to use Emacs is to use a Linux terminal. You may not know this, but Linux is not as scary as you think it is. It is actually free and accessible, provided you use a CLI. The best thing is to run a terminal emulator for the exercises; if you want to run performance tests, you can install an LTS linux distribution and dual-boot your PC. I know it will come as a shock to you, you Windows user, but I am using a MacBook these days. The reason is that it is the only OS that will allow me to emulate all the other OSes; and also because it has a native terminal application that supports the Linux commands.</p>

            <p>My message would not be complete without some advice on time-management. Here is a good exercise on it: Leave things alone when you time is up and you have to go. And I, my friend, have to go.</p>
