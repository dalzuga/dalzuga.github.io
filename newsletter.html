	<h1>Hi, my name is Daniel!</h1>
	<p>This is my first web page :)</p>
	<h2>I am excited to be using SSH</h2>
	<p>I was easily able to set up the website on my MacBook because
	    OS X comes with a built-in terminal.<p>
	  <p> I really liked logging in to a remote server and doing
	      everything from the shell.</p>
	  <h3>I learned to set it up on Windows because I like a
	      challenge!</h3>
	  <p>In order to do this, I used cygwin. I've also done a couple of
	      other things which I have yet to decide to write about.</p>
