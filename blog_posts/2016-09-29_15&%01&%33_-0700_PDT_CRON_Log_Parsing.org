# CRON_Log_Parsing [working title]

Outline:

* The Exercise
  By using this cron log:
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/holbertonintranet/files/sandbox/cron

  Please provide the list of all cron commands with the delay ("The
  cron task 'Holberton' is executed each 50 seconds")
* Assumption
  Since we are in interview prep mode, we have generally considered it

  I didn't actually ask this question. But I consider it important to
  understand the assumptions that I am making.
* Almost correct solution

* Minor mistake corrected

* Extensions
