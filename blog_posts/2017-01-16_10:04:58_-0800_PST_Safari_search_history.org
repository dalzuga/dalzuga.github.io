* Safari search history [working title]
If you are a power-user on OS X, and rely on your history as much as I
do, you may have encountered a pesky Safari property: while the pages
you visit remain in your history, your search engine searches will not
be recorded if the search is made above the line of death. In other
words, any searches done from google.com will show up on your search
history, but if you search from the "Address and Search" bar, it will
not show up in your history (at least on Safari Version 10.0.2).

To get around that, just type:

~defaults find searchstring~ into your terminal. Voila!
