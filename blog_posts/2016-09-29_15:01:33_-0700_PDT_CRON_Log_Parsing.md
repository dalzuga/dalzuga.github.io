# CRON_Log_Parsing [working title]

Recently, as part of our daily routine of preparing for SRE interview
questions, Guillaume started sending us a packet of exercises. While I
found it personally satisfying to use regular expressions to parse one
of its problems, this same problem was particularly interesting to
me. It was a good exercise in thought process, and worthy of a write-up
on its own.

The exercise is as follows
```
By using this cron log:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/holbertonintranet/files/sandbox/cron Please
provide the list of all cron commands with the delay ("The cron task
'Holberton' is executed each 50 seconds")
```

As part of interview prep mode, with some good pointers from Sylvain,
every time I began a problem, I adopted the routine to think of as
many clarifying questions before coding the solution. This wasn't an
interview, so I didn't actually ask this question. But I considered it
important to understand and write down, for the benefit of the
exercise, assumptions that I am making when I process the problem.

This problem jumped out at me because the assumption I generated was
particularly ugly, and worthy of further exploration:

## Explanation of assumption:

Consider, for a moment, that I parse the log correctly, that I count
all the commands, and I proudly display the delay of each command.

As part of my strategy to make sure I don't overlook any special cases
(and also for maximizing the learning I get from each problem), I like
to consider the worst of a problem before breaking it down into
smaller chunks. So, as a thought experiment, I decided to consider
that my input data is massive. Imagine thousands of commands, numbered
1 through n, with each of their counts accessible via a `count`
function that takes the command being run as its input.

The rationale for this is simple: more information I have, the
better. While this is a terrible way to approach a problem, I like to
do this test. Just by thinking of this, it occurred to me that this
problem must not have a solution. Or, at least, not a unique
solution. The clarifying question that jumped at me was as follows: "Can I
assume that each command is run by exactly one CRON job?"

Since Guillaume is not generally in the habit of asking trick
questions (like Julien is) I found it safe to assume this at this
point. In an interview, I'd make sure to ask if this is the case.

### Assumption: each command is run by one and only one CRON job.

So now, the problem is better-defined. I have this particular log; so
let's parse it.

First, I decided to count how many unique CRON commands I need to
handle. Also, I decided to count how many CRON commands there are in
total:

```
uniqueCmdCount: 10
count by CROND: 1999
```
