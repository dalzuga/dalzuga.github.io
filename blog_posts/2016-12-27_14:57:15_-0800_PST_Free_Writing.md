# Free Writing

What did I want to free-write about?

I need to take a shower. I have a haircut appointment in one hour.

I'm reading about Semantic Linefeeds.

I just published a blog post on my website.

I thought about centering the blog post titles.

I figured out that .rst comes with its own metadata feature.

I wanted org to be unique.

I want to organize using org.

I want to eventually have an AI that organizes well with org.

I have many ideas. I don't want to be thought of as a manic person.

I am looking for an idea I had. It was an important idea.

I am losing this idea.

I'm watching youtube videos.

Structured free-writing is an interesting idea.

Get creative.

Oh, margins. Oh, I remember one important idea.

That idea was to center the blog post titles.

No, that was not the idea, but I feel it's related.

Space between lines. My website needs more.

I think I should check out Google Fonts to pick fonts.

My titles need to be bigger.

I need to do Salesforce.

I need to email Arnaud.

I'm so upset that I don't know if I'm missing an idea.

It's related to the rst file.

I'm looking at the rst source file.

I think I need to change fonts for the title of my blog post. I think
this was the key idea. Specifically, this is the idea I need to put
into action. After this, I have to add comments to my blog. And
separate the blog posts. Reverse those last two sentences.
