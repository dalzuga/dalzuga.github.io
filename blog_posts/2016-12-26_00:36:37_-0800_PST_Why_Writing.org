* Why Writing

Free writing is great. It provides a better-than TV way of relaxing.
It envelops the mind, not with a hug, but with a foam that expands
from within. It nurtures. It relaxes.

And it allows you to go back to a piece of history that is your own,
later down the road.

Ever wondered if you had an idea that you wish you could remember as
clearly as you did before? Well, if you write something about it, you
may be able to look it up.

I'm making it my goal to free write more often. I've never kept an
old-style diary for very long, partially because it's not very
efficient for me.

I prefer the speed of touch-typing on a keyboard. Things flow. I'm not
afraid to make a mistake, as it is easily correctable.
