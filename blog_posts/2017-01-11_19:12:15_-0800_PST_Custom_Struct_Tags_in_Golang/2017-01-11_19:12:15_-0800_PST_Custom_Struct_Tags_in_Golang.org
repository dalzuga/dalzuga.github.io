* Custom Struct Tags in Golang [working title]

I was playing with struct values to parse an XML file.

[[insert%20structs.go%20at%20v0.3][insert code for structs.go at v0.3]]

I tried to do something along the lines of Image 2:

Image 2:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 800px
[[file:images/Screen Shot 2017-01-11 at 7.08.56 PM.png]]

Upon trying this, gometalinter gave me an error:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1000px
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 1000px
[[file:images/Screen Shot 2017-01-11 at 7.32.25 PM.png]]

I couldn't do it. This is not allowed. I googled around a bit, but
found nothing indicating this could be done. This approach was not
going to be an easy path to getting the outcome that I wanted.

On the other hand, I did discover this:

Image 3:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 750px
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 750px

Loading this snippet on Golang Play:

Image 1:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 1000px

At the time I saw this example, I started to look at my problem in
another way.

If I wanted to parse an XML file in the general case, I don't really
need to worry about the names of the fields. With the NumField()
method on the ~reflect.Value~, I can iterate over all the struct
elements. I can simply use an array.

I have function getAuthorID at commit
be2a8c806936140611139cd9fafc609ac397d334 (daniel/work branch):

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 1000px
[[file:images/Screen Shot 2017-01-11 at 8.11.25 PM.png]]

which relies on the following structs in HEAD^^ commit:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 1000px
