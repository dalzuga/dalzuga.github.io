	<h1>Toot toot toroot toot: SSH on my windows PC at home!</h1>

	<p>Cygwin is a linux emulator for Windows that works on most
	    operating systems. Now that I am in San Francisco, I can
	    access my computer desktop in New York from the command
	    line... just like the server on this website! I have spent
	    probably too much time configuring and playing around with
	    it, but that only means I have learned a few things to fill
	    this page with :)</p>

	<h2>Aliases</h2>

	<p>After installing cygwin and openSSH, I was able to remotely
	    connect to my computer at home. But one thing that I
	    realized is that I cannot remember the IP address of my
	    computer at home every time I want to log in.</p>

	<p>This is where aliases come into play. I discovered that I
	  can have aliases for frequent commands both on my local
	  MacBook laptop as well as on the remote machine.</p>

	<h3>On my local MacBook</h3>

	<p>On my MacBook Air with OS X El Capitan 10.11, I modified my
	  '.bash_profile' file. The file can be accessed with Emacs with
	  the following command</p>

	<p>emacs ~/.bash_profile</p>

	<h3>On my remote Windows 7</h3>

	<p>For some reason, what worked above did not work remotely on
	  Cygwin. I figured out that you have to modify a different
	  file, and everything works after that :) I edited a file
	  called '.bashrc' using Emacs. The command to do this is as
	  follows:</p>

	<p>emacs ~/.bashrc</p>

	<h3>My bash aliases</h3>

	<p>This is what my bash file looks like. I can now log into
	  the holberton server and to my home server without having to
	  look up the IP addresses on my machines!</p>

	<img alt="screenshot showing example commands." src="bashfile.png">

	<p>After saving the changes and closing and re-opening my
	    terminal windows, I can simply type "holberton" into the
	    terminal and I will be taken straight onto my Holberton Level
	    2 website. :)</p>

	<h3>SSH keys, to avoid remembering the password!</h3>

	<p>Unfortunately, we cannot change the root password on this
	      challenge, and the password is impossible to remember! I
	      have to copy and paste the password every time I log in
	      to the Holberton server. There is way to avoid the
	      password altogether using SSH keys!</p>

	<p><strike>I got an SSH key I generated to work with my computer at
	      home, but I spent way too much time doing this and so I
	      am pressed for time to finish the challenge and won't be
	      able to explain it at this point.</strike></p>

	<p><b>The Secure SHell (SSH) can work with different encryption
	types. The one we will use is RSA.</b></p>

	<h2>How SSH-RSA encrypted keys work to authenticate you</h2>

	<p>There are two keys. One that encodes (public key), and one
	that decodes (private key). The public key is not capable of
	decoding, and it can be generated from the private key. Think
	of the private key as a &quot;master&quot; key. It is able
	to <i>lock</i> and <i>unlock</i>. The public key can
	only <i>lock</i>.</p>

	<h3>Generating keys</h3>
	
	<p> First, we create a private key. Second, we generate a
	public key from the private key.</p>
